                      My name is Andrew Wilkinson, recent graduate from the 
                      University of Massachusetts Lowell with a degree in Computer
                      Science. I'm starting my journey with this website here, 
                      to become a Game Designer and eventually create some amazing 
                      games, either with my friends and colleagues I've met along 
                      the way or help create them at one of the many great game companies
                      we have today.
                      <br/><br/><br/>
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class="box"> 
                      I've always had a strong interest in gaming and game culture since I was raised
                      on a Nintendo and Super Nintendo. Since then I've played on nearly all consoles
                      either through emulators or the physical device itself, and a wide variety of
                      game genres to boot. Currently I find that PC gaming is more accessible 
                      not only from a gamer's perspective, but from a developer's perspective as well.
                      The ability to generate an executable that can be run and delivered easily has
                      great appeal as opposed to the very specific way you have to program for consoles...

                      I'm a pretty avid gamer now and play most of my games through Steam.

                      Mr. Android</a>, feel free to friend me! Also by the 'tag' at the end of my name
                      you can see I"m a proud founding member of The FUN-Gineers. Check out
                      our website, <a class="plain" href="http://fungineers.net">The FUN-Gineers</a>, 
                      it was created by the same person who made the background and color choice of 
                      this website, Jason Patrick.

                      My plan is to use this website as a means to show all my projects from past
                      and present. It will be my professional website as well as my personal website.
                      Hopefully the people who visit this site will find some of the projects useful
                      in their own programming endeavors. Thank you for reading!
