                      My name is Andrew Wilkinson and I am a recent graduate from the Rochester Institute of 
                      Technology (RIT) with a MS in Game Design and Development. I received my BS in Computer Science
                      at the University of Massachusetts Lowell, but felt that to get closer my dreams of 
                      game development I should make a new academic pursuit. RIT was a wonderful experience full
                      of wonderful people who gave me the resources and environment to teach myself the skills 
                      required for game development.

                      I enjoy playing a large variety of games and genres, but most of my game time is spent 
                      on the digital distribution platform, Steam. My account is at <a class="plain" href="http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrAndroid">
                      Mr. Android</a>, feel free to friend me! I'm also a founding member of a small
                      gaming community known as The FUN-Gineers. Check out our website, <a class="plain" href="http://fungineers.net">The
                      FUN-Gineers</a>, it was created by the same person who made the background and color choice of 
                      this website, Jason Patrick.
