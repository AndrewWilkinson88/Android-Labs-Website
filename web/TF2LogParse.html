                      This project was also a very exciting project for me to work on.
                      My visualization class called for a project that either created a
                      new visualization or performed a data analysis on a set of data
                      we created. I thought it'd be neat if I used some data from
                      the game <a class="plain" href="http://teamfortress.com">Team Fortress 2</a>, 
                      being hosted on the FUN-Gineers server, a gaming community I helped start. 
                      I didn't have enough time to parse out a years worth of data, 
                      but hopefully someday I'll be able to perform a more in depth 
                      analysis.

                      For this assignment, I used the largest log file we had for a single
                      running time of the server. A log is generated as long as there is 
                      players on the server and than it stops when there are none. This Log
                      ran for 32 hours or so before the server finally cleared out. I got some
                      interesting results which allowed me to make this presentation
                      located here: <a class="plain" href="http://goo.gl/ylF5V">TF2 Presentation</a>
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class="box">
                      There were more many interesting things I was noticing just looking over
                      the data I had pulled from the log file, but due to time constraints
                      I only made an analysis about the kills+assists to deaths ration by class,
                      to determine the most well played classes. Here are some of the graphs
                      from the presentation below.

                      Two things about the coding with this project that I had I never dealt
                      with before, Python and Regular Expressions. Both of these things
                      were a strong driver for writing my own code as I really wanted to learn
                      them. My friend is a python guru and made the language sound so useful.
                      RegEx seemed easy enough, but I only found after I finished my project
                      I wasn't using them correctly and could've made string parsing a lot easier.
                      By using "submatches" I could've saved matched strings to variables and
                      than had access to those... Where as I did everything the hard way and
                      used string functions like split to break down the log lines. Lesson
                      learned however and someday I'll edit this code so it's cleaner and uses
                      RegEx more effectively! If you would like the source it's right here:
