This project is a NetBeans project, and should be edited using NetBeans.

I implement the whole website using CSS 3, and HTML 5. A goal of the website is to use very little pictures, and make it look nice just through CSS formating. The actual design(initialy layout, color scheme, background) of the site is credited to Jason Patrick, where as I worked on the code portion, and minor edits to the layout.
