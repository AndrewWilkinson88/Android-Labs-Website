This project was created as an educational experience for myself and to host my portfolio. I implemented the website using CSS 3, and HTML 5. A goal of the website is to use very little pictures, and make it look nice just through CSS formating. The actual design(initial layout, color scheme, and background) of the site is credited to Jason Patrick who used an unknown web template to intially create it. I took the design and reimplemented it from scratch.
